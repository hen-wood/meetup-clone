# About the project

Meetdown is a clone of [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/). Users can create an account, and create groups. Groups can be updated and deleted as well. Depending on their status in a group, users can also create Events. Events can be deleted, but not updated (yet).

## What I'm Most Proud Of

I'm proud of the styling in general. I think it comes very close to pixel perfect, especially on the splash page. I made specific SVGs from meetup in to react components and used them throughout the site. I love vector graphics! I'm also proud of the upcoming implementation of Amazon S3, to allow uploads of user files.

## Upcoming features

- Functionality to request/approve/update membership status in a group
- Functionality to request/approve/update attendance status for an event
- Ability to upload images for groups and events
- User profile pictures
- Full CRUD on events
